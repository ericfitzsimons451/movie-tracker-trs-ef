## Background/About

### This project was our first paired project as a Mod 3 student.  We were tasked with making fetch calls to external APIs, using both GET and POST requests.  It was the first project where we were asked to use Redux for our data storage and React Router for explicit pathways through our single-page application.  The project also implements a test suite using Jest/Enzyme and styling with Sass.
